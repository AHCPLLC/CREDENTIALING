Dear American Medical Association,

We are a product Healthcare IT organization. We are building a credentialing system for potential customers. At this point, we are looking
for a possible solution for integrating our system program with one of the American Medical Association in real-time over the internet.
If such service from your end exists, then kindly let us know if you help us in answering below queries

1. Who can call upon your service? Any restriction or Agreements persist? 
2. What are the features of the service?
3. Is service real-time without any manual intervention?
4. How about the pricing?
5. What are the data elements or demographics that services are capable for rendering?
6. Can we connect to technical team for support? If so, what is the preferred way?
 
We believe having access to American Medical Association service through our software will greatly improve efficiency, reduce error and liability in Health care system.

Sincerely,
